Zionist Union MK Ksenia Svetlova , a former Arab affairs reporter for Russian - language media who has written for The Jerusalem Post , initiated the discussion and said , “ Freedom of action for the media is a central component in a democratic state . Unfortunately , recently , it seems that some reporters are seen as the enemy or as a foreign agent acting against the State of Israel . ”She added , “ Violence against the press hurts Israel ’s good name in the world . ”Foreign Press Association secretary Gila Sugarman said that in the past two years there has been an increase in physical violence against journalists and their equipment . Union of Journalists in Israel chairman Yair Tarchitsky called the phenomenon fairly common and said the violence generally comes from low - level soldiers or police officers who are not aware of the way they should treat the press . “The general feeling is that they see journalists as an annoyance , ” he said . “ Security forces have to understand the job of the press in a democratic country , even if the truth is uncomfortable for the country . Our job is to reflect reality as it is to the broader public . ”Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Tzachi Hanegbi ( Likud ) closed the meeting by calling the IDF Spokesperson ’s Unit to review the complaints from press representatives and make sure that they are present in sensitive situations to hold a dialogue with reporters . “IDF commanders are not trained or authorized to deal with the press ; it ’s not their responsibility , ” Hanegbi said . “They are focused on security and executing their operational orders . The IDF Spokesperson ’s Unit must send people to events with the potential for conflict , in order to avoid obstacles to reaching operation goals , on the one hand , and harm to journalists ’ work , on the other . ”Hanegbi also said he will discuss the issue with Interior Committee chairman David Amsalem ( Likud ) , whose panel is responsible for overseeing police and border police actions , to hold a similar discussion about complaints of police treatment of the press .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Correspondence for discussion\", \"arguments\": {\"participant\": \"they\", \"place\": \"Israel\"}}"}
