The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . Since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U . S . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"ThreatenCoerce\", \"arguments\": {\"Communicator\": \"NAN\", \"Recipient\": \"NAN\"}}"}

Advertisement “ We ’ ve seen this around the world , but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn ’ t happened here , not like this . Until yesterday , ’’ said a senior homeland security official in Washington . The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags , according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources , another similarity with some Mideast attacks using “ improvised explosive devices , ’’ or IEDs . One of the bombs used in a foiled attack in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker . A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple attacks in Afghanistan , Pakistan , India , and Nepal . Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB ’ s , nails , and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage . That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993 , which were intended to inflict damage on buildings , as well as people . IED ’ s pack a much smaller punch , are cheaper , and easier to carry . They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles .

Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U .

Colombia has asked Cuba to hand over the rebels affiliated with National Liberation Army ( ELN ) , who were in Havana for peace talks , after a deadly car bombing in Bogota was blamed on the group . Conservative President Ivan Duque urged Communist - ruled Cuba , a host and one of the guarantors of the peace process , to send home the ELN rebels in Havana . Cuba ’ s foreign minister said in a tweet late on Friday that the country would respect the protocols of the negotiations it had been hosting and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks . On Friday , Colombia blamed the leftist ELN for the bombing of a police academy in Bogota that killed 20 people as well as the attacker , dealing a big blow to the peace process . 190102132047518 Duque then announced that he was reinstating arrest warrants for 10 ELN members , who are part of the group ’ s delegation to the Cuba talks . The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist - inspired group . Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels . The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ” , Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima . Colombians , including Duque , planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing , the worst such attack in the country in 16 years .

The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez . The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue . Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then - President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) fighters . 190118182118648\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Correspondence\", \"arguments\": {\"Communicator\": \"NAN\", \"Topic\": \"NAN\", \"Recipient\": \"NAN\"}}"}

But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 . Afghan civilian casualties have been high , with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016 . The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period . We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015 . Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term . The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush ’ s term , after four years pocked by occasional strikes . However in the year after taking office , Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency .

The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained . They are described as ethnic Uighurs , a minority group based in China ' s Xinjiang region . They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September . Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai .

Seven \\\" incident centres \\\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces . Before the truce , the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974 , mostly in and around London . Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974 . == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham , Surrey . The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat . There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the injuries were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process . This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government . The next day , the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street , injuring several people . == Aftermath == One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \\\" carbon copy \\\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences . The cell ' s campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street . The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which , along with the bombings , caused the deaths of nearly 20 people , injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Disabling or defusing\", \"arguments\": {\"Artifact\": \"NAN\", \"Disabler\": \"NAN\"}}"}

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . At a meeting Friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Observing through sensory perception\", \"arguments\": {\"ObservedEntity\": \"NAN\", \"Observer\": \"NAN\"}}"}

Kieran Conway , who was head of the IRA ’ s intelligence - gathering department in the 1970s , broke a 40 - year silence by the organisation to make the admission . He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the death of IRA bomber James McDade . At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ” . But he was later told that the IRA unit involved had tried to use “ a succession of phone boxes ” which were out of order , significantly delaying the bomb - warning call .

Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB ’ s , nails , and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage .

S . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors . It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . Venezuela ’ s interior minister , Nestor Reverol , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \\\" special techniques and [ radio ] signal inhibitors \\\" , which \\\" disoriented \\\" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand — a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have . The second drone was said by Reverol to have \\\" lost control \\\" and crashed into a nearby building . Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . \\\" It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [ of the state TV broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech ] , \\\" it further suggests . Here ’ s its conclusion : From the open sources of information available , it appears that an attack took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech .

The talks , in Feakle , County Clare , involved senior IRA officials and Protestant clergymen and ended abruptly after a tip - off that Irish Special Branch officers were on their way to arrest the republicans .

He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the death of IRA bomber James McDade . At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ” .

The police academy car bombing “ was a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [ Cuba acting ] to avoid justice being done ” , Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima . Colombians , including Duque , planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing , the worst such attack in the country in 16 years . Last rebel group In November , Colombia asked Cuba to capture ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory . The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez . The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue . Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then - President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) fighters . 190118182118648 With the landmark agreement turning the former rebels into a political party , the smaller ELN is considered the last active rebel group in the country . True to his election promises , Duque has taken a hard line against the ELN . Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under Santos , but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets . The group is believed to be currently holding 17 hostages , some of them for several years .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Conducting a trial or hearing\", \"arguments\": {\"JudgeCourt\": \"NAN\", \"Defendant\": \"NAN\", \"Place\": \"NAN\"}}"}

Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai . Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China , where it is feared they face persecution . The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , DNA matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people .

His chair and table shook , he said , and he saw people being taken away in ambulances . “ We didn ’ t know what it was and so , at first , we just kept eating , ” said Salomon , 52 , who was visiting his son in the city . “ But then we realized something was wrong . ” Others did not hear the explosion but saw the aftermath . When Jacob Schulman left his apartment a few blocks away shortly before 9 p . m . , he saw people running and screaming . AD “ I didn ’ t know what was going on , but everyone looked so panicked . I started running . too , ” said Schulman , 26 , who has lived in the neighborhood since 2014 . Two blocks from the blast scene , a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie “ Beauty and the Beast ” and saw the flashing lights . One man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting . President Obama was briefed on the situation in New York and will be updated as more information becomes available , a White House official said late Saturday .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Broadcast\", \"arguments\": {\"Communicator\": \"Salomon\"}}"}

In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U .

Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street .

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use .

He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing . He spoke only once , when U . S .

Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U .

But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 . Afghan civilian casualties have been high , with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016 . The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period . We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015 . Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term . The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush ’ s term , after four years pocked by occasional strikes . However in the year after taking office , Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency .

But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 .

The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . Since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U . S . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 .

It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model , although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed . Venezuela ’ s interior minister , Nestor Reverol , also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \\\" special techniques and [ radio ] signal inhibitors \\\" , which \\\" disoriented \\\" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand — a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have . The second drone was said by Reverol to have \\\" lost control \\\" and crashed into a nearby building . Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion . It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . \\\" It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [ of the state TV broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech ] , \\\" it further suggests .

Kieran Conway , who was head of the IRA ’ s intelligence - gathering department in the 1970s , broke a 40 - year silence by the organisation to make the admission . He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the death of IRA bomber James McDade . At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ” . But he was later told that the IRA unit involved had tried to use “ a succession of phone boxes ” which were out of order , significantly delaying the bomb - warning call .

Birmingham pub bombings : Minute by minute - 24 hours that changed our city forever Funding for the terrorists dried up almost overnight and the bombings , which left 21 dead and almost 200 injured , including many maimed for life , cost them hugely in the propaganda war .

Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai . Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China , where it is feared they face persecution . The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , DNA matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people .

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . At a meeting Friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Investigating a crime\", \"arguments\": {\"Investigator\": \"NAN\"}}"}

He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the death of IRA bomber James McDade . At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ” .

He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the death of IRA bomber James McDade . At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ” . But he was later told that the IRA unit involved had tried to use “ a succession of phone boxes ” which were out of order , significantly delaying the bomb - warning call .

The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags , according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources , another similarity with some Mideast attacks using “ improvised explosive devices , ’’ or IEDs . One of the bombs used in a foiled attack in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker . A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple attacks in Afghanistan , Pakistan , India , and Nepal . Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB ’ s , nails , and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage .

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use .

The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism .

They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September . Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others .

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use .

Bush . Obama embraced the US drone programme , overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency . A total of 563 strikes , largely by drones , targeted Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen during Obama ’ s two terms , compared to 57 strikes under Bush . Between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries , according to reports logged by the Bureau . The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable , costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia . But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 .

Seven \\\" incident centres \\\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces . Before the truce , the IRA active service unit ( ASU ) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang ( due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege ) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974 , mostly in and around London . Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974 . == The bombing == The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham , Surrey . The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat . There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9 : 20 , injuring 23 civilians and 10 off - duty soldiers . The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby . Some of the injuries were very serious , with at least three soldiers losing limbs . The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process . This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign ( Phase Two ) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government . The next day , the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street , injuring several people . == Aftermath == One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \\\" carbon copy \\\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences . The cell ' s campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street . The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which , along with the bombings , caused the deaths of nearly 20 people , injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Manufacturing or assembling\", \"arguments\": {\"Place\": \"NAN\", \"ManufacturerAssembler\": \"NAN\", \"Artifact\": \"NAN\"}}"}

The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained . They are described as ethnic Uighurs , a minority group based in China ' s Xinjiang region . They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September . Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others .

The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . Since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U . S . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Attack\", \"arguments\": {\"Instrument\": \"drones\", \"Target\": \"president\"}}"}

Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China , where it is feared they face persecution . The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government .

The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . Since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U . S . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Correspondence\", \"arguments\": {\"Communicator\": \"NAN\", \"Topic\": \"NAN\", \"Recipient\": \"NAN\"}}"}

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . At a meeting Friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Conducting a trial or hearing\", \"arguments\": {\"JudgeCourt\": \"NAN\", \"Defendant\": \"NAN\", \"Place\": \"NAN\"}}"}

But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 . Afghan civilian casualties have been high , with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016 . The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period . We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015 . Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term . The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush ’ s term , after four years pocked by occasional strikes . However in the year after taking office , Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency . The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Demonstrate\", \"arguments\": {\"Demonstrator\": \"NAN\"}}"}

Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai . Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China , where it is feared they face persecution . The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , DNA matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people . Police believe that Bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and Yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Meet\", \"arguments\": {\"Topic\": \"NAN\", \"Place\": \"NAN\", \"Participant\": \"NAN\"}}"}

S . investigators have questioned the parents of the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects in the Russian republic of Dagestan , as they try to determine what might have influenced their sons in the months before the April 15 attack . The American authorities , working with Russian security forces , interviewed both parents Tuesday night and called back the suspects ' mother , Zubeidat Tsarnaev , for more questioning on Wednesday . The investigators are particularly interested in any contacts the elder brother , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , might have had with Islamic extremists during a six - month visit to Dagestan and Chechnya last year . U . S . lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies . Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev ' s trip to Russia . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday , while his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later . Meanwhile , in Boston , authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street , the city thoroughfare where the explosions occurred near the finish line of the race . Later , several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier , who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers shot to death three days after the bombings . Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency did know about Tamerlan ' s trip , but that an FBI alert on him had expired by the time he returned . The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at Russia ' s request , but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time .

In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U .

Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street .

Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism .

Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured .

Last year Ghani has said 28 , 000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015 , breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data . Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack . Zabiullah Mujahid , a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack . Last week , Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital , Kabul . On Sunday , a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen dead and another 10 wounded . The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor ' s convoy in Mohammad Agha district . The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed . The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months , while Afghan and U . S . troops have increased operations against the militants ' field commanders . Military sources say around 35 members of the country ' s security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes . This is while the U . S . is still considering a significant troop drawdown in Afghanistan . Around 14 , 000 U . S . troops are stationed in the country , coupled with around 7 , 500 troops from other allied nations , according to RAND , a U . S . government research organization . In a report on Sunday , RAND said that if the U . S . considers \\\" an early and complete or near - complete departure unrelated to a negotiated peace settlement , \\\" it could push Afghanistan into a civil war while the Taliban would expand their control throughout the country .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Injure\", \"arguments\": {\"Victim\": \"10\"}}"}

Bush . Obama embraced the US drone programme , overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency . A total of 563 strikes , largely by drones , targeted Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen during Obama ’ s two terms , compared to 57 strikes under Bush . Between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries , according to reports logged by the Bureau . The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable , costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia . But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 .

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities .

This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data .

That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 .

Kieran Conway , who was head of the IRA ’ s intelligence - gathering department in the 1970s , broke a 40 - year silence by the organisation to make the admission . He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the death of IRA bomber James McDade . At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ” .

It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed . \\\" It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated , creating the hole in the wall of this apartment , igniting a fire , and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [ of the state TV broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech ] , \\\" it further suggests . Here ’ s its conclusion : From the open sources of information available , it appears that an attack took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech . Both the drones appear visually similar to DJI Matrice 600s , with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model . These drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade . The first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade , the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the Venezuelan government and pictured on social media . The second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage , and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described . It also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media , calling itself \\\" Soldados de Franelas \\\" ( aka ‘ T - Shirt Soldiers ’ — a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t - shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity ) , suggesting it ’ s not clear from the group ’ s Twitter messages that they are \\\" unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event \\\" , owing to use of passive language , and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers — which it says \\\" does not appear to be supported by the open source information available \\\" .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"ThreatenCoerce\", \"arguments\": {\"Communicator\": \"NAN\", \"Recipient\": \"NAN\"}}"}

Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation .

Seven \\\" incident centres \\\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces .

Kieran Conway , who was head of the IRA ’ s intelligence - gathering department in the 1970s , broke a 40 - year silence by the organisation to make the admission . He admitted he was “ appalled and ashamed ” because he claimed the bombing of civilians went against everything it stood for . He said the attacks on The Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in The Town had been in revenge for the death of IRA bomber James McDade . At first he feared that the timing of the attacks - with very little warning - had been deliberate because “ tempers were high ” . But he was later told that the IRA unit involved had tried to use “ a succession of phone boxes ” which were out of order , significantly delaying the bomb - warning call .

The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Contact\", \"arguments\": {\"Participant\": \"Chuchart Kanpai\"}}"}

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . At a meeting Friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Identifying or categorizing\", \"arguments\": {\"Identifier\": \"NAN\", \"Place\": \"NAN\", \"IdentifiedObject\": \"NAN\"}}"}

He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing . He spoke only once , when U . S . District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday . \\\" Yes , sir , \\\" Rahimi said . Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U .

Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi ' s movements on the day of the bombings , including leaving his house carrying bags , walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street .

The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , DNA matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people .

A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well - known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda , Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years , The Pakistani Taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the attack , unlike the attempted car bombing in New York ’ s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for . But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so - called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks . In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so - called improvised explosive devices — some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday . “ The threat from IED use is likely to remain high in the near future , and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them , ’’ according to a new strategy approved by President Obama on February 26 . “ A whole - of - government approach that integrates Federal , state , local , tribal , territorial , private sector , and global participation in counter - IED activities will best position the United States to discover plots to use IEDs in the United States , or against U .

Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai . Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China , where it is feared they face persecution . The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Conducting a trial or hearing\", \"arguments\": {\"JudgeCourt\": \"NAN\", \"Defendant\": \"NAN\", \"Place\": \"NAN\"}}"}

Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others . The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb . Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai . Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China , where it is feared they face persecution . The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , DNA matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people . Police believe that Bilal is the yellow - shirted man who planted the bomb and Yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Detonating or causing an explosion\", \"arguments\": {\"Place\": \"shrine\"}}"}

A total of 563 strikes , largely by drones , targeted Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen during Obama ’ s two terms , compared to 57 strikes under Bush . Between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries , according to reports logged by the Bureau . The use of drones aligned with Obama ’ s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable , costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia . But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 . Afghan civilian casualties have been high , with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016 . The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period .

Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai . Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China , where it is feared they face persecution . The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing . But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive , sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human - smuggling gang . Still , skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks , contradictions , misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation . The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of “ national security ” have been handled by the military since last May , when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government . Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed - circuit television footage , witnesses , DNA matching and physical evidence , in addition to their confessions . Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T - shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine , took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away . Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred , during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people .

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities . Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial , service and entertainment use . At a meeting Friday , task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"Charging or indicting\", \"arguments\": {\"Defendant\": \"NAN\", \"Prosecutor\": \"NAN\"}}"}

He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing . He spoke only once , when U . S . District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight - count indictment filed on Wednesday . \\\" Yes , sir , \\\" Rahimi said . Prosecutors have accused the Afghan - born U . S . citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan ' s Chelsea neighborhood on Sept . 17 . It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people . The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey , although that detonation did not injure anyone . Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth , New Jersey . In addition to the New York indictment , Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey . He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden , New Jersey . The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds , delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed . Assistant U .

The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror .

Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China , where it is feared they face persecution . The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists , who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing .

The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast , including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder . Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror , and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism . Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained . They are described as ethnic Uighurs , a minority group based in China ' s Xinjiang region . They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September . Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people - smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation . The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades , and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured . Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry . Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss , but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests . Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others .

But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism . The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “ exceptionally surgical and precise ” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “ innocent men , women and children in danger ” . This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups , however , and the Bureau ’ s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case . The White House released long - awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015 , an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data . However the US ’ s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau , which at 380 to 801 was six times higher . That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014 . The country has since come under frequent US bombardment , in an unreported war that saw 1 , 337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40 % rise on 2015 . Afghan civilian casualties have been high , with the United Nations ( UN ) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016 . The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period . We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015 . Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama ’ s first term .

Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto , 40 , turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan . The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices , the prime ministers ' office has said . The infiltration at Japan ' s political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there . No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident . Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister ' s office . He has not been indicted and faces further questioning . Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government ' s nuclear energy policy . Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan ' s 48 reactors , which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami - triggered Fukushima plant disaster . Abe ' s administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible . The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium , levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment . The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima , where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai - ichi meltdowns , NHK said . The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities .

Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained . They are described as ethnic Uighurs , a minority group based in China ' s Xinjiang region .

Of the dead , 14 were tourists . The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness , which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror . Authorities , however , have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country ' s huge tourism industry .

Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived , said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai . Doubts about motive Early speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China , where it is feared they face persecution .

S . as an immigrant from Russia , enjoying the benefits of living here and then attacking American citizens . “ He is a leech , abusing the privilege of American freedom , and he spit in the face of the American dream , ” said Jennifer Rogers , an older sister of slain MIT Officer Sean Collier . Bill Richard , whose 8 - year - old son , Martin , was the youngest person killed in the bombing , said Tsarnaev could have backed out of the plot and reported his brother to authorities . Instead , Richard said , “ he chose hate . He chose destruction . He chose death . This is all on him . ” Richard noted that his family would have preferred that Tsarnaev receive a life sentence so that he could have had “ a lifetime to reconcile with himself what he did that day . ” Richard said his family has chosen love , kindness and peace , adding : “ That is what makes us different than him . ” Fatima Tlisova of VOA ' s Russian service contributed to this report from Boston .

The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives . The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred . Initial video from a state - owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro , those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera . But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions . AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim — suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat . Since then more footage has emerged , including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building . Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack , including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro ’ s speech , and using frame - by - frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up . The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s , each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and , when detonated , capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters . DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model , normally used for industrial work — with a U . S . price tag of around $ 5 , 000 apiece , suggesting the attack could have cost little over $ 10k to carry out — with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially ( for demolition purposes ) at a cost of around $ 30 . Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government ’ s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600 , noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors .\"}", "label": "{\"event_type\": \"RequestCommand\", \"arguments\": {\"Communicator\": \"NAN\", \"Recipient\": \"NAN\"}}"}
